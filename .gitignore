# We might want to track public if we deploy via docs folder, 
# but for gh-pages branch method, we usually build it. 
# However, if user wants "serve in their pages", committing public might be easiest for them if they use /docs method.
# Let's Keep public in git but ignore .env CRITICAL.
# Correcting logic: The user wants to deploy.
# If I use `git subtree push --prefix public`, `public` MUST be committed.
# So I will NOT ignore public.
